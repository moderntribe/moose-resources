# Block Library

A collection of custom blocks.

## Guidelines

1. Blocks should be created in their own directory with a descriptive name.
1. Block directories should utilize the provided `README-sample.md` file in the root directory.
1. Link to the block README file below!
1. Blocks should follow the version naming scheme of `0.1-alpha` for in progress blocks, `1.0-beta` for complete blocks that may need polishing, and `>1.0` for stable versions of the block.
