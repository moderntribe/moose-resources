## What does this component do?

This block needs more definition but currently this component consists of two blocks, one Slider Container block and one Slider Slide block. 

## Example Usage

This component needs more definition before we can define usage.

### Moose Implementation

1. Copy directory to the `themes/core/blocks/tribe/` directory.
1. Add the `tribe/slider-container` and `tribe/slider-slide` blocks to the `self::TYPES` array in `plugins/core/src/Blocks/Blocks_Definer.php`.
1. Run `npm run dist` to build the blocks.
