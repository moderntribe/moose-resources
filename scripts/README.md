# Scripts

A collection of block editor level scripts (global, not tied to a block).

## Guidelines

1. Scripts should be created in their own directory with a descriptive name.
1. Script directories should utilize the provided `README-sample.md` file in the root directory.
1. Link to the script README file below!
1. Scripts should follow the version naming scheme of `0.1-alpha` for in progress scripts, `1.0-beta` for complete scripts that may need polishing, and `>1.0` for stable versions of the script.
