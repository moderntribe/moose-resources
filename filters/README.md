# Filters

A collection of PHP block filter overrides.

## Guidelines

1. Filters should be created in their own directory with a descriptive name.
1. Filter directories should utilize the provided `README-sample.md` file in the root directory.
1. Link to the filter README file below!
1. Filters should follow the version naming scheme of `0.1-alpha` for in progress blocks, `1.0-beta` for complete filters that may need polishing, and `>1.0` for stable versions of the filter.
